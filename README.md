# S3-Triggered Data Ingestion for Klaviyo

This package contains scripts and directions to quickly setup a system to automatically ingest csv files to import events and profiles properties in Klaviyo.

Though this package can be easily configured to operate on any data/scripts, it is pre-configured to run the following package, which enables flexible ingestion of CSV data with a simple config: https://github.com/jon-batscha/config-csv-ingestion

## Included Files

#### `architecture.png`

Graphic overview of data flow

#### `lambda_function.py`

Lambda function that is triggered by file-drop: launches instance, downloads scripts/data, deletes CSV file from s3, and terminates instance

#### `FUTURE_UPDATES.md`

Backlog of features in the pipeline as we continue improving this workflow

# Setup

NOTE: we are working on converting this package (and other automations) into a CloudFormation, for greater portability. For the timebeing, please follow the below setup instructions, and feel free to reach out to the SE team for clarity.

## Component Policies

This package assumes the following components + policies:

- Lambda:
	- Launch EC2 with a given role, and terminate it
		- for lambda to assign a role, it needs either admin permissions or a specific passrole policy
	- send SSM commands
- EC2 Role:
	- The lambda launches an EC2 with a role determined by you. This role needs policies to:
		- read/write from Lambda's trigger S3 bucket

## Configure Components

### S3 Bucket

Expected structure of s3 bucket

- project_name
	- data
		- csv files are dropped here to trigger processing (each file launches its own EC2)
	- scripts
		- config-csv-package; if you change these scripts, be sure to also update the config section at the top of `lambda.py`

### Lambda

- Adjust timeout setting accordingly (in basic settings): this needs to be just enough for the EC2 to launch and be added to SSM, but we have ours set to 10 mins just to be safe (it almost always shuts off within a minute)
- Add s3 trigger and configure trigger settings
- copy `lambda.py` to lambda function, and update config at top of file
